						<h1><strong> Media Literacy &#38; Global Change</strong> </h1> 
						<p class='bigIdea'>
							The Engagement Lab is working across the world to build networks that inspire collaboration across borders, across cultures, and across divides. Through the creation of curriculum, media action plans, and multimedia storytelling, our work in media literacy and global change aims to help build stronger formal and informal learning opportunities for civic and community leaders around the world. We bring together various stakeholders and emerging leaders to help build our networks, and our partners engage in comparative research that explores the role of media literacy in addressing some of the most pressing social, global and political challenges that face our world today. To see our global media literacy network, partners, and content, please see <a href='http://www.salzburg.umd.edu/'>salzburg.umd.edu</a>.

							Our engagement games and play-based projects are all designed not just to facilitate official processes, education, and real-world action, but to natively be real-world actions themselves. They are designed and built in cooperation with our <a href='/about/#partners' target='_blank'>partners</a>.

						<h1><strong> Civic Technologies</strong></h1> 
						<p class='bigIdea'>
							Technology can open up doors and give a voice to people that seldom engage in civic processes, especially youth and families who feel disenfranchised from those processes. The civic technologies developed by the Lab foster productive communication by shifting the direction of conversation from top-down (planners to people) to bottom up (people to planners) and lateral (people to people), creating stronger communities, more engaged citizens, and increased trust and agency.
