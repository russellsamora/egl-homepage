								Since 1990, Chinatown, a 46-acre neighborhood in Boston, 
								has been engaged in several master-planning processes to 
								determine the future growth pattern of the neighborhood. 
								Located in downtown Boston, Chinatown has presented a 
								challenging context for planning: as an ethnically and 
								socio-economically diverse area in the shadow of the 
								rapidly gentrifying financial and theater districts, the 
								neighborhood has had to embrace gentrification while 
								struggling to maintain its unique identity both as a Chinese 
								community and as a welcoming place for new immigrants. 
								Over the course of the last several decades, the Chinatown 
								community has engaged in countless community meetings 
								meant to engage the residents of the neighborhood in the 
								decision-making process. Every ten years, the process starts 
								again so that the community may assess past changes and 
								plan for the future. The recently completed 2010 master 
								plan took the form of five public meetings between July 2009 and June 2010.
							</p>
							<p>
 								The resulting plan was meant to guide conversation for the coming decade. In addition to 
								the traditional mechanism of engaging the community in town-hall style meetings, Participatory Chinatown was introduced into the process in order to create better learning and increase diversity of participants.

							<h2>The Game</h2>
							<p>
								You assume the role of one of 15 virtual residents and work to complete your assigned quest - finding a job, housing, or place to socialize. But look out! Sometimes language skills, income level, or other circumstances can make your task more challenging. Whatever your experience, you'll then be tasked with considering the future of the neighborhood by walking through and commenting on proposed development sites. Every one of your comments and decisions will be shared with real life decision-makers.
								Participatory Chinatown is a multi-user game designed to 
								be played in real time, in a shared physical space. The 
								game was built using the Sandstone platform by Muzzy 
								Lane. We chose Sandstone because its built-in 
								features were conducive for educational games and because 
								we were able to use it to build a game capable of running in 
								a web browser.
							</p>
							<p>
								The game launched on the evening of 3 May 2010 in a 
								large community room in Boston's Chinatown, where 48 
								people from the community gathered to play. The space 
								was filled with five long rectangular tables, each with the capacity to fit 10 or 15 laptops. A projection screen was placed in the front of the room to which the facilitators on 
								occasion asked players to direct their attention. But the 
								conversation and digital interactions taking place at the 
								individual tables was the focal point of each player's 
								experience. In addition to the physical proximity of players 
								sharing a table, each table represented a multi-player game 
								where players could interact in a shared virtual 
								environment. While all players were playing the same 
								game, there were five distinct instances of the game going 
								on at once with about 10-15 players in each instance. The 
								meeting was facilitated in such a way that the small group 
								interactions at the tables and in the virtual Chinatown were 
								periodically shared with the front of the room. This was 
								meant to produce a dynamic environment that could extend 
								the game dynamics into the physical room. To address 
								Chinatown's diverse language needs, the game was 
								playable in either English or Chinese, and a translator was 
								present throughout the meeting.

							<h2>The Real-World Action/Results</h2>
							<p>
								The community's knowledge that this public meeting 
								would be based around the Participatory Chinatown game 
								attracted different people to the meeting; it also created 
								different expectations of what was to happen at the 
								meeting. It is unknown to what extent the novelty of a 
								"game meeting" played into Participatory Chinatown's 
								high attendance or energetic participation; the high 
								attendance at the meeting actually required some 
								participants to have to share a single laptop, and thus a 
								single character. Rather than diminishing the experience, 
								this seemed to promote greater cooperation and 
								deliberation as the two players had to come to a consensus 
								about the decisions to make for their shared character.
								The game cultivated the player connection to character in 
								two ways: 1) through the explication of biographical detail 
								in narrative form, and 2) through the experience of moving 
								an avatar with a specific biography through a familiar 
								environment.
							</p>
							<p>
								Participatory Chinatown
								demonstrated that an immersive, role-playing experience 
								can give participants in a community meeting a strong 
								feeling of connection to the neighborhood and a deep 
								understanding of the issues in play. Players were willing to participate in the 
								game because it quickly became clear to them how the 
								exercise was enhancing their sense of connection to the 
								local context. The game did not feel peripheral to their 
								civic participation, but rather part of it. Walking the 
								neighborhood in someone else's shoes was a recognizable 
								and enjoyable tactic to immerse players in a context of 
								decision-making that is often not clear in the traditional 
								town hall meeting. The characters introduced the players to 
								details about the neighborhood, including its physical 
								boundaries and demographic specificity. But more 
								importantly, the characters assured that each player would 
								be introduced to a diversity of perspectives about the 
neighborhood's "objective" issues.
