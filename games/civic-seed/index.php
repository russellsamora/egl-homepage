								<span><a target='_blank' href='http://civicseed.org'>Civic Seed</a></span> is a multi-player RPG that harnesses the power of online social play to teach and certify students to civically engage with partner communities. Students must think creatively, self-reflect, and collect resources to complete the game and create their sharable civic resume.

								Context
							</h2>
							<p>	
								Many incoming university students are eager to get involved with their school's partner communities and create positive change. However, to most, the people and challenges of these communities are unknown, and under-trained volunteers can even do more harm than good.
							</p>
							<p>
								For local organizations, it's difficult to know which students have the necessary knowledge and skills to collaborate effectively and whose personal goals align with the goals of the organization and the community.  Civic Seed is designed in cooperation with Tufts University's <a href="http://activecitizen.tufts.edu/" target="_blank">Tisch College of Citizenship and Public Service</a>, which promotes a culture of active citizenship for Tufts students throughout the university and in their communities.

								In Civic Seed, students get to explore a fantastical world, engage with the people who live there, and work together to solve a mystery and help bring the world back to life. 

								Reflective learning is mixed with puzzle-solving, social gaming, and collaborative art.

								Learning through play makes it easy to engage with, reflect upon, and apply new knowledge. Civic Seed lets students learn how to tackle issues systematically and internalize information through experience instead of just memorizing for a quiz.

								<span>Real Learning-</span> Players take part in a reflective, collaborative learning process that prepares them to engage effectively in partner communities and make a positive, informed impact.

								<span>The Civic Resume-</span> By playing the game, student-players not only learn about civic engagement, they become certified to civically engage with their partner communities. Game actions and responses are recorded and transformed into a civic resume -- a sharable profile, owned by the player, that lets partners understand a student's background, skills, goals, and motivations.
