								<span>Hub2</span> was a pilot project in Boston, Massachusetts, which employed the virtual world Second Life as a means of engaging residents in the planning of a neighborhood park.

							</h2>
							<p>	
								This project focused on one key challenge - the limitations among the untrained public to adequately understand abstract space. But urban planning poses other challenges as well. Most notable is conflict negotiation. Planning issues often involve conflicting interests coupled with deep resentments and community divides. Building a new highway, for example, is seldom only a question of the highway's design, but the destiny of the land, the community, and individual residents.

								Hub2 was supported by the City of Boston, the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) and the Allston Development Group (ADG) of Harvard University, and took place from June to August of 2008. The project consisted of formal in-person workshops, where groups of participants immersed themselves in a virtual space, moved things around, proposed ideas, role played, and experienced various spatial configurations. It also included informal drop-in hours, where community members individually experienced the design and contributed their ideas in the online conversation about the park. The project was designed as a supplement to traditional community meetings that were facilitated at the same time by ADG.
							</p>
							<p>
								The core of the Hub2 project was the in-person workshop. In each 90-minute session, up to 15 participants gathered in the local community center and sat around tables configured in a V pattern. Participants sat in front of laptops with the Second Life application running. While Second Life is an expansive three-dimensional environment wherein tens of thousands of users occupy spaces, play games and build, Hub2 participants saw only a small piece of this environment - a place called Boston Island. The island included a 3D model of the park space, complete with the surrounding buildings and structures. Each participant was given an avatar - a digital character that they could move around the space. As participants inhabited the space, they would see the back of their avatar's head as well as the avatars of all other participants. In this virtual group setting, they were invited in to explore the park space.
							</p>
							<p>
								Participants were given a particular 'skin' for their avatar - an old man in a wheelchair, a small child, a woman and a dog - and they were asked to act out certain scenarios, such as walking to the library from the picnic area or parking their car and entering the garden. Once completed, participants would have the opportunity to verbalize reactions and suggest physical changes. The last 20 minutes of each 90-minute workshop was devoted to individual commentary. Participants could walk through the space to leave comments and plant virtual flags in the ground by an object or area of interest. They could then vote on the flagged spaces. Flags would turn shades of red or green depending on the number of likes or dislikes. Players could also comment within flags, adding specific notes to given areas. Comments could be read by all and were saved as part of the 'virtual sketch' of the overall session. Each virtual sketch was saved and made available to the larger community, including architects, planners, and developers.

							<p>
								Hub2 facilitated eight workshops, with a total of 120 people participating, about half of whom were under 25 years old. Throughout the 3 months of the project, drop-in hours took place Monday through Friday from 3 to 5 in the afternoon and on Saturdays from noon to 3. Approximately 75 people attended these informal sessions, some of whom returned to participate in one of the formal workshops. To help facilitate the meetings, four 'youth interpreters' were hired. These internet-savvy local youth served a dual purpose: 'technology experts' who aided participants with the computers, and viral advertisements who attracted young participants to the process. The latter purpose was clearly effective, as Hub2 workshops attracted more than 60 participants aged 14-25, compared to zero in this age range in the traditional meetings which occurred in the same time frame.
