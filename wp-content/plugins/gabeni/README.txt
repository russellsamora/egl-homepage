Gabeni is an easy to use backup service that backs up and restores your ENTIRE WordPress website (including uploads and database) to Gabeni server storage.

== Description ==

Gabeni enables automated backups and 1 click restore of ANY wordpress installation. This is the only plugin that takes care of the retore process as well as the backup process.

The initial, free account, gives you 100MB of storage on our servers. You can keep only one backup file per domain and the plugin will not run automatic backups in the background.
For $10 a year, you will have a consistent 200MB storage for your WordPress backups, automated backups that will run per schedule in the background and you will not be limited to 1 backup per domain.


* No complicated setup
* No technical knowledge required!
* 100% safe backups!

**So how does it work?**

*It's very easy.*

When you download and enable the Gabeni plugin, you will be asked to enter your email address, first name and last name. 
Once you do that, the Gabeni plugin will automatically contact the Gabeni servers and create your account on the Gabeni servers. 
The initial, free account, gives you 100MB of storage on our servers. You can keep only one backup file per domain and the plugin will not run automatic backups in the background. To backup your WordPress simply click on "Backup Now".
Once you decide to upgrade your account you will be able to schedule backups, rotate backups and enjoy more storage space.

*That's it!*

Gabeni has a very friendly interface where you will be able to see a list of your backups and if required - you will be able to select a backup to restore with one simple click. We will even backup your existing configuration automatically before every restore.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do I have to pay you? =

You don't *have* to, but you can. As a paying customer you will be able to schedule backups, rotate backups and enjoy more storage space
Gabeni is not a standard plugin. We actually *host* your backup files on our servers in redundant (very expensive) storage, so that you don't have to.


= Is there a limit to the number of times I can restore a website or backup a website? =

No. No limit. Feel free to go wild!

= Can I backup on one server and restore on another? =

Yes. When you install the plugin and tell it that you already have an account - you will have the option to login to your account with your existing credentials.
Once you do that - your backup list will automatically be populated with all your backups and you will be able to choose one to restore from.
